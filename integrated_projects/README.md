# integrated_projects

## per open source project
Please use/create open source project specific folders.

## integrated open source project specfic documentation
If you want to document/share stuff related to a specific open source project (integrated with snooss) please do this project specific.

Example:
Describing a wazuh specific configuration:
- path: snooss-hub/integrated_projects/wazuh
- filename for md file: wazuh_docker_cis_benchmarking.md
- filename for img file: wazuh_docker_cis_benchmarking.img
- filename for conf file: wazuh_docker_cis_benchmarking.conf

Simply said: stay structured :-)
